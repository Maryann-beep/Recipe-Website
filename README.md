## 🧪 My Process

### 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Custom Properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Git & GitHub for version control

### 🌱 What I Learned

- Leveraged semantic HTML to improve accessibility and structure.
- Practiced using custom properties for maintainable styling.
- Learned how to organize content hierarchically for readability and clarity.

```html
<section class="ingredients">
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
  </ul>
</section>
```

```css
:root {
  --color-accent: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```

### 🔭 Continued Development

Going forward, I’d like to:
- Practice building multi-page layouts
- Explore accessibility enhancements like ARIA roles
- Learn CSS animations for micro-interactions
